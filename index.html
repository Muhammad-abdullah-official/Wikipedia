            In computer science, the dining philosophers
            <br>
            problem is an example problem often used in concurrent algorithm
            design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them.
            <br>
            <br>
            It was originally formulated in 1965 by Edsger Dijkstra as a student exam exercise, presented in terms of
            computers competing for access to tape drive peripherals. Soon after, Tony Hoare gave the problem its
            present
            form.[1][2][3][4]


        <h3>Problem statement</h3>
        <p>Five philosophers dine together at the same table. Each philosopher has their own place at the table. There
            is a
            fork between each plate. The dish served is a kind of spaghetti which has to be eaten with two forks. Each
            philosopher can only alternately think and eat. Moreover, a philosopher can only eat their spaghetti when
            they
            have both a left and right fork. Thus two forks will only be available when their two nearest neighbors are
            thinking, not eating. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they will put down both forks. The
            problem is how to design a regimen (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each
            can
            forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others
            may
            want to eat or think (an issue of incomplete
            information).</p>

        <h3>Problems</h3>
        <p>
            The problem was designed to illustrate the challenges of avoiding deadlock, a system state in which no
            progress
            is possible. To see that a proper solution to this problem is not obvious, consider a proposal in which each
            philosopher is instructed to behave as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>think unless the left fork is available; when it is, pick it up;</li>
            <li>think unless the right fork is available; when it is, pick it up;</li>
            <li>when both forks are held, eat for a fixed amount of time;</li>
            <li>put the left fork down;</li>
            <li>put the right fork down;</li>
            <li>repeat from the beginning.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            However, they each will think for an undetermined amount of time and may end up holding a left fork
            thinking,
            staring at the right side of the plate, unable to eat because there is no right fork, until they starve.
            <br>
            <br>
            Resource starvation, mutual exclusion and livelock are other types of sequence and access problem.

        <h3>Solutions</h3>
        <hr>
        <h3><b>Dijkstra's solution</b></h3>
        <p>Dijkstra's solution uses one mutex, one semaphore per philosopher and one state variable per philosopher.
            This solution is more complex than the resource hierarchy solution.[5][6] This is a C++20 version of
            Dijkstra's solution with Tanenbaum's changes:

    <p>
        The function test() and its use in take_forks() and put_forks() make the Dijkstra solution deadlock-free.

    <div>
        <h3>Resource hierarchy solution</h3>
        <p>
            This solution assigns a partial order to the resources (the forks, in this case), and establishes the
            convention that all resources will be requested in order, and that no two resources unrelated by order will
            ever be used by a single unit of work at the same time. Here, the resources (forks) will be numbered 1
            through 5 and each unit of work (philosopher) will always pick up the lower-numbered fork first, and then
            the higher-numbered fork, from among the two forks they plan to use. The order in which each philosopher
            puts down the forks does not matter. In this case, if four of the five philosophers simultaneously pick up
            their lower-numbered fork, only the highest-numbered fork will remain on the table, so the fifth philosopher
            will not be able to pick up any fork. Moreover, only one philosopher will have access to that
            highest-numbered fork, so he will be able to eat using two forks. This can intuitively be thought of as
            having one "left-handed" philosopher at the table, who -- unlike all the other philosophers -- takes his
            fork from the left first.
            <br>
            <br>
            While the resource hierarchy solution avoids deadlocks, it is not always practical, especially when the list
            of required resources is not completely known in advance. For example, if a unit of work holds resources 3
            and 5 and then determines it needs resource 2, it must release 5, then 3 before acquiring 2, and then it
            must re-acquire 3 and 5 in that order. Computer programs that access large numbers of database records would
            not run efficiently if they were required to release all higher-numbered records before accessing a new
            record, making the method impractical for that purpose.[2]
            <br>
            <br>
            The resource hierarchy solution is not fair. If philosopher 1 is slow to take a fork, and if philosopher 2
            is quick to think and pick its forks back up, then philosopher 1 will never get to pick up both forks. A
            fair solution must guarantee that each philosopher will eventually eat, no matter how slowly that
            philosopher moves relative to the others.
            <br>
            <br>
            The following source code is a C++11 implementation of the resource hierarchy solution for five
            philosophers. The sleep_for() function simulates the time normally spent with business logic.[7]

            Arbitrator solution
        </h3>
        <p>
            Another approach is to guarantee that a philosopher can only pick up both forks or none by introducing an
            arbitrator, e.g., a waiter. In order to pick up the forks, a philosopher must ask permission of the waiter.
            The waiter gives permission to only one philosopher at a time until the philosopher has picked up both of
            their forks. Putting down a fork is always allowed. The waiter can be implemented as a mutex. In addition to
            introducing a new central entity (the waiter), this approach can result in reduced parallelism: if a
            philosopher is eating and one of his neighbors is requesting the forks, all other philosophers must wait
            until this request has been fulfilled even if forks for them are still available.

            <video src="vid.webm" align="right" width="300px" controls></video>
            A solution presented by William Stallings[8] is to allow a maximum of n-1 philosophers to sit down at any
            time. The last philosopher would have to wait (for example, using a semaphore) for someone to finish dining
            before they "sit down" and request access to any fork. This guarantees at least one philosopher may always
            acquire both forks, allowing the system to make progress.

            Chandy/Misra solution
        </h2>
        <p>
            In 1984, K. Mani Chandy and J. Misra[9] proposed a different solution to the dining philosophers problem to
            allow for arbitrary agents (numbered P1, ..., Pn) to contend for an arbitrary number of resources, unlike
            Dijkstra's solution. It is also completely distributed and requires no central authority after
            initialization. However, it violates the requirement that "the philosophers do not speak to each other" (due
            to the request messages).
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>For every pair of philosophers contending for a resource, create a fork and give it to the philosopher
                with the lower ID (n for agent Pn). Each fork can either be dirty or clean. Initially, all forks are
                dirty.</li>
            <li>When a philosopher wants to use a set of resources (i.e., eat), said philosopher must obtain the forks
                from their contending neighbors. For all such forks the philosopher does not have, they send a request
                message.</li>
            <li>When a philosopher with a fork receives a request message, they keep the fork if it is clean, but give
                it up when it is dirty. If the philosopher sends the fork over, they clean the fork before doing so.
            </li>
            <li>After a philosopher is done eating, all their forks become dirty. If another philosopher had previously
                requested one of the forks, the philosopher that has just finished eating cleans the fork and sends it.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This solution also allows for a large degree of concurrency, and will solve an arbitrarily large problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also solves the starvation problem. The clean/dirty labels act as a way of giving preference to the most
            "starved" processes, and a disadvantage to processes that have just "eaten". One could compare their
            solution to one where philosophers are not allowed to eat twice in a row without letting others use the
            forks in between. Chandy and Misra's solution is more flexible than that, but has an element tending in that
            direction.
            <br>
            <br>
            In their analysis, they derive a system of preference levels from the distribution of the forks and their
            clean/dirty states. They show that this system may describe a directed acyclic graph, and if so, the
            operations in their protocol cannot turn that graph into a cyclic one. This guarantees that deadlock cannot
            occur. However, if the system is initialized to a perfectly symmetric state, like all philosophers holding
            their left side forks, then the graph is cyclic at the outset, and their solution cannot prevent a deadlock.
            Initializing the system so that philosophers with lower IDs have dirty forks ensures the graph is initially
            acyclic.
